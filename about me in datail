# Internship Application – R&D Engineering Team, Synopsys (Noida)

## Why I’m a Good Fit
I have a strong background in Digital Design, Verification, and Design for Testability (DFT) concepts, with experience in both theoretical and practical aspects.
My prior internship experience in DFT at Cadence (1 year) allowed me to work on scan chain architecture, ATPG, and fault modeling, giving me hands-on exposure to 
industry-level tools and flows.

I am highly motivated to contribute to the R&D team at Synopsys and learn from cutting-edge projects that impact the semiconductor industry.

## Relevant Skills
- **Programming:** C, Verilog, SystemVerilog.
- **Methodologies:** UVM
- **Digital Design:** Computer Architecture, RTL Design, FSM, Timing Analysis
- **DFT Concepts:** Scan Chain Insertion, Test Compression, Fault Simulation
- **Tools & Environment:** Linux/Unix, Shell scripting

## Relevant Experiences
- **M.Tech in VLSI Design, NIT Kurukshetra** – Coursework in DFT, SoC Design, Verification, and Physical Design.
- **Internship at Cadence (DFT Team)** – Worked on scan compression strategies, ATPG, and low-power test methodologies.
- Developed multiple RTL-based mini-projects and verification testbenches.

******************PROJECTS************************

****32-bit RISC Processor using Verilog*****

Implemented a 32-bit RISC processor using Verilog, Implemented basic I-type, R- type, and J-type
instructions. Checked the functionality of the modules by writing testbenches.

*******Design and Verification of AMBA - APB Protocol*****

Written RTL code and testbench for APB modules in System Verilog, Verified the data transfer
between Master & Slave, Analyzed waveforms for any protocol violations.
Tools used: Xcelium

*******Design of 6T SRAM *******

Designed 6T SRAM, analyzed waveforms for read and write operations, and designed a sense
amplifier using TSMC 180 nm CMOS devices.
Tools used: LTspice
